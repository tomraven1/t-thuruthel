summary: PhD call (September 2023)

I am advertising few PhD positions available in the new research centre in Autonomous Robotics in the Department of Computer Science at University College London. 
The research topics are broadly in the field of soft robotics, learning-based control, soft sensing technologies, and applied machine learning, starting in September 2023.
Please fill out this expression of interest before 1st of December for the initial screening process (https://forms.gle/3TbicE8BwjAABGN6A) (**we will not consider applications by email**), which will ask you to submit:

- a CV
- a research proposal (can be from 1-3 pages) [Download template for research proposal]  (link)

By mid-December, we will review all expressions of interest and get in touch with you to discuss next steps.

If you are unsure about anything or have questions, please do get in touch.

**Note: This is not an official application to UCL's PhD program.**

You will have to apply through the [general PhD admissions site] (link), and you will also see UCL's various degree programs.

Have a look at our [CDT for Foundational AI] (link) as a great option for a PhD program. Here is a longer list of [PhD programs within UCL's Computer Science department] (link).

We will not consider applicants to UCL's PhD program, who did not submit an expression of interest.

### Funding and Scholarships
Note: Funding for PhD students must be obtained through scholarship programs. There are several scholarships available, e.g., through the university. There are some [overseas scholarships](link) available at UCL.
