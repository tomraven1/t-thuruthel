I do not have personal funding for students at the moment, but I am always looking for excellent and highly-motivated PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and visiting researchers.

### Funding and Scholarships
Note: Funding for PhD students can also be obtained through scholarship programs. There are several scholarships available, e.g., through the university. There are some overseas scholarships available at UCL [link](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ucl.ac.uk%2Fprospective-students%2Fscholarships%2Fgraduate%2Fovers-res%2Fors&amp;data=05%7C01%7Ctg444%40universityofcambridgecloud.onmicrosoft.com%7Cb4572fe1219b469a55aa08dab35e237b%7C49a50445bdfa4b79ade3547b4f3986e9%7C0%7C0%7C638019514139329648%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=4JA5qc8uUhrt78%2B5GgosTDcyvWvRnRGp8DZlC5Uc3Eo%3D&amp;reserved=0).
