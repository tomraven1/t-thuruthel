Soft robots are high-dimensional dynamical systems that exhibit complex nonlinear behaviors. Modelling and control of these systems is a challenging task and some of these projects investigate the use of Machine Learning techniques for this problem. 




**_Static Shape Control of Soft Continuum Robots using Deep Visual Inverse Kinematic Models_**

Soft continuum robots have immense potential in numerous industrial applications because of their high flexibility and adaptability. This makes them more suited for working in unstructured environments such as the human body, or in agriculture, compared to their traditional rigid-linked counterparts. However, their high compliance and high manoeuvrability also make them hard to model, sense, and control. Existing control strategies focus on the Cartesian space control of the end-effector, whereas there are few works looking into the full-body control of these complex systems. This work presents a novel image-based deep learning approach for closed-loop kinematic shape control of soft continuum robots. The method combines a local inverse kinematics formulation in the image-space with deep convolutional neural networks for accurate shape control that is robust to feedback noise and mechanical changes in the continuum arm. The shape controller is fast and straightforward to implement; it takes only a few hours to generate training data, train the network, and deploy, requiring only a web camera for feedback. We then show that this technique is capable of a highly intuitive and user-friendly form of teleoperated 3D shape/configuration control when given only 2D hand-drawn images of the desired target state.
